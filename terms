Dispute Resolution:

Please carefully read this Arbitration Agreement as it affects your rights and forms part of your contract with the Company.

Applicability of Arbitration Agreement:
Any claims and disputes, except for those seeking injunctive or equitable relief or that can be resolved informally or in small claims court, shall be resolved through binding arbitration on an individual basis as per the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. This agreement applies to you, the Company, as well as its subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors, assigns, and authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under these Terms.

Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution:
Before initiating arbitration, the party must send a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief, to the other party. If both parties fail to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after receiving the Notice, either party may commence an arbitration proceeding. Any settlement offers made by either party must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until the amount of the award, if any, is determined.

Arbitration Rules:
Arbitration will be conducted through the Lagos Court of Arbitration (LCA), an established alternative dispute resolution provider. If LCA is unavailable, an alternative ADR Provider will be selected by mutual agreement. The arbitration will be governed by the rules of the selected ADR Provider, except to the extent they conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be handled by a single, neutral arbitrator, and the arbitrator’s judgment may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party will bear its own costs, including attorney’s fees, and share the fees and costs of the ADR Provider equally.

Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration:
If non-appearance based arbitration is chosen, the proceedings may be conducted by telephone, online, or solely based on written submissions, as decided by the initiating party. Personal appearances by the parties or witnesses will not be required unless agreed upon.

Time Limits:
Arbitration must be initiated within the statute of limitations and any deadline set forth in the LCA Rules for the specific claim.

Authority of Arbitrator:
The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities of the parties, and the dispute will not be consolidated or joined with any other case or party. The arbitrator has the authority to grant monetary damages and any non-monetary remedy or relief allowed under applicable law, the LCA Rules, and these Terms. The arbitrator’s award is final and binding, and has the same authority to award relief as a judge in a court of law.

Waiver of Jury Trial:
By agreeing to this Arbitration Agreement, both parties waive their rights to a jury trial and elect to resolve all claims and disputes through arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, efficient, and less costly than court proceedings.

Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions:
All claims and disputes under this Arbitration Agreement must be resolved on an individual basis, and class actions or consolidated claims are not allowed. Claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or user.

Confidentiality:
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including the award and compliance, must be kept strictly confidential, except as required by law. This confidentiality clause does not prevent either party from submitting information to a court of law to enforce the Agreement, seek injunctive or equitable relief, or enforce an arbitration award.

Severability:
If any part of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that specific part will be severed, and the remaining provisions will continue to be valid and enforceable.

Right to Waive:
The parties may waive any rights or limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement, but such waiver will not affect any other portion of the Agreement.

Survival of Agreement:
This Arbitration Agreement will remain in effect even after the termination of your relationship with the Company.

Small Claims Court:
Either party may bring an individual action in small claims court, irrespective of this Arbitration Agreement.

Emergency Equitable Relief:
In cases where emergency equitable relief is required to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, either party may seek such relief from a court.

Claims Not Subject to Arbitration:
Certain claims, including defamation, violation of the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property, are not subject to arbitration under this Agreement.

Courts:
In cases where the Arbitration Agreement permits litigation in court, both parties agree to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
